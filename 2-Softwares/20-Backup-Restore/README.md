# üß† Backup & Restore of Embedded Flash Memory (GD25Q127C)

## Overview

The Lidl Silvercrest gateway includes a GD25Q127C  flash chip (recognized as GD25Q128C by the Linux kernel) storing the bootloader, Linux kernel, root filesystem, and Zigbee configurations.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**  
> Flashing or altering your gateway can permanently damage the device if done incorrectly.  
> Always ensure you have verified backups before proceeding.

This guide explains how to **back up and restore** the embedded flash memory using three distinct methods, depending on your level of access to the system:

---

## üîß Method 1 ‚Äì Linux Access via SSH

‚úÖ Use this method if the gateway is bootable and reachable over SSH.

### üîÑ Backup

On the gateway (via `ssh`), run:

```sh
dd if=/dev/mtdx of=/tmp/mtdx.bin bs=1024k
```

Replace `x` with `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` or `4`.

‚ö†Ô∏è You must unmount `mtd4` before dumping it, as it is typically mounted read/write.

On the host, retrieve the file using `ssh` (adjust port and IP as needed):

```sh
ssh -p 2333 -o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa root@<gateway_ip> "cat /tmp/mtdx.bin" > mtdx.bin
```

Once you have collected all partitions, concatenate them into a full image:

```sh
cat mtd0.bin mtd1.bin mtd2.bin mtd3.bin mtd4.bin > fullmtd.bin
```

üí° Refer to the script section at the end of this README to automate this process.

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Restore

‚ö†Ô∏è Only restore partitions that are **not mounted**.  
- `mtd0` to `mtd3` are usually safe to write.  
- `mtd4` (overlay) is mounted read/write ‚Äî unmount it before restoring.

To restore, first transfer the file to the gateway:

```sh
ssh -p 2333 -o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa root@<gateway_ip> "cat > /tmp/rootfs-new.bin" < rootfs-new.bin
```

Then flash it:

```sh
ssh -p 2333 -o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa root@<gateway_ip> "dd if=/tmp/rootfs-new.bin of=/dev/mtd2 bs=1024k"
```

üí° Refer to the script section at the end of this README for a simpler approach.


## üîß Method 2 ‚Äì Bootloader Access (UART + TFTP)

üü† Use this method if Linux no longer boots, but the Realtek bootloader is still accessible via UART.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If Linux fails to boot, it may be due to a corrupted partition.  
- In that case, backup via the bootloader might be **unreliable or incomplete**,  
- but restore can be useful **if you have previously created a valid backup using Method 1**.


### üõ† Setup

This second method will use Realtek bootloader's `FLR` and `FLW` commands to transfer files via TFTP. Therefore, a TFTP server must be running on your host.**

#### Install a tftp client & server on your linux host
```sh
sudo apt install tftpd-hpa tftp-hpa
# start the tftp server daemon
sudo systemctl start tftpd-hpa
```
The default `tftpd-hpa` configuration file is in `/etc/default/tftpd-hpa` and looks like:
```
TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
TFTP_DIRECTORY="/srv/tftp"
TFTP_ADDRESS=":69"
TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"
```
This indicates that the directory used by `tftpd` to store received files or files to be sent is `/srv/tftp`. We need to set up directory access to be able to use it locally:
```
sudo mkdir -p /srv/tftp
sudo chown tftp:tftp /srv/tftp
sudo chmod 775 /srv/tftp
sudo chmod g+s /srv/tftp
sudo usermod -a -G tftp $USER
newgrp tftp
```
You can now read/write to this directory from your $USER account.

#### Accessing the Bootloader
- Connect a USB-to-serial adapter to your host, and wire its RX/TX pins to the gateway's UART interface.
- Power on the gateway and repeatedly press ESC until the <RealTek> prompt appears on the serial console.

---

### üîÑ Backup (via `FLR`)

This procedure allows you to **extract the content of a specific MTD partition** from flash memory to RAM, and then download it to your host using `tftp`.

The command `FLR` (Flash Load to RAM) instructs the bootloader to:
- Read data from the SPI flash starting at the given offset
- Load it into a specified address in RAM

Then, the bootloader automatically exposes the RAM content via `tftp`, allowing the host to download it.

#### Example: Backup of the `rootfs` (mtd2)

On the bootloader:
```plaintext
FLR 80000000 00200000 00200000
```

- `80000000` ‚Üí RAM address where data will be loaded
- `00200000` ‚Üí flash offset of mtd2
- `00200000` ‚Üí size of the partition in bytes (here: 2 MiB)

From the host:
```sh
tftp -g -r mtd2.bin 192.168.1.6
```

This command downloads the content from RAM to your local machine, storing it as `mtd2.bin`.

üí° You can repeat this process for each MTD partition (see reference table below).


---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Restore (via `FLW`)

The `FLW` (Flash Write from RAM) command allows you to **write binary data stored in RAM** into a specific region of the SPI flash.

This is typically used after a file has been transferred to the gateway via TFTP and loaded into RAM at a known address.

The command format is:
```plaintext
FLW <flash_offset> <ram_address> <length> 0
```

- `flash_offset`: destination in SPI flash (in hex)
- `ram_address`: where the data is stored in RAM (in hex, e.g. `80500000`)
- `length`: number of bytes to write (in hex)
- `0`: SPI controller number (always `0` on these devices)

#### Example: Restore of the `rootfs` (mtd2)

1. On the bootloader:
```plaintext
LOADADDR 80500000
```

2. From the host, upload the file:
```sh
tftp -i 192.168.1.6 put mtd2.bin
```

3. Back on the bootloader, write to flash:
```plaintext
FLW 00200000 80500000 00200000 0
```

This writes the file `mtd2.bin` (2 MiB) to SPI flash at offset `0x00200000`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Always double-check offset and size before writing to flash. This process is destructive.

‚ö†Ô∏è All values must be in **hexadecimal**. `AUTOBURN` should be **disabled** (default).

## üîß Method 3 ‚Äì SPI Programmer (CH341A or Equivalent)

üî¥ Use this method only if the bootloader is corrupted or the gateway is completely unresponsive.

This method involves **physically desoldering the SPI flash chip (GD25Q127C)** from the board and using a USB SPI programmer (such as a CH341A) to read or write its content.

### üõ† Required Hardware

- A **CH341A** USB SPI programmer (inexpensive and widely available)
- A SOP8 to **200 mil** DIP adapter to insert the chip into the programmer
- **Flux** and either **desoldering braid** or a **small desoldering pump**

‚ö†Ô∏è The use of a programming clip **does not work** on the gateway board and is not recommended. 

### üîÑ Backup using `flashrom`

Once the chip is removed and inserted into the SOP8-to-DIP adapter on your CH341A programmer, you can safely back it up.

To read the full 16 MB content:

```sh
flashrom -p ch341a_spi -c GD25Q127C -r fullmtd_backup.bin
```

- `-p ch341a_spi`: use the CH341A in SPI mode
- `-c GD25Q127C`: specify the chip model
- `-r`: read mode (dump flash to file)

‚úÖ Make sure the chip is powered at 3.3V and properly seated in the adapter.

After the backup, you can inspect or split the image if needed using tools like `dd` or `binwalk`.

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Restore using `flashrom`

To write a previously saved image (like **fullmtd.bin** previously created using Method 1) back to the flash chip:

```sh
flashrom -p ch341a_spi -c GD25Q127C -w fullmtd.bin
```

- `-w`: write mode (flash binary to chip)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Be careful:** This operation will completely overwrite the chip content.  
Ensure that `fullmtd.bin` is exactly **16 MiB (16,777,216 bytes)** and contains valid data.
