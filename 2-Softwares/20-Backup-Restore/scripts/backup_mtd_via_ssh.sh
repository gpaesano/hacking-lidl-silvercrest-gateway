# backup_mtd_via_ssh.sh
#
# Description:
#   This script performs a full backup of the Lidl Silvercrest gateway's flash memory (GD25Q127C)
#   using SSH access to the embedded Linux system.
#
#   For each MTD partition (/dev/mtd0 to /dev/mtd4), it:
#     - creates a temporary dump on the device with dd
#     - transfers it back to the host over SSH
#     - deletes the temporary file
#   Finally, it concatenates all partitions into a single 'fullmtd.bin' image.
#
#   Note: mtd0-mtd3 are typically unmounted after being loaded into RAM, but mtd4 (JFFS2)
#   may need to be unmounted before backup to ensure data consistency.
#
# SSH access to the gateway: port 22 by default, change if needed
# Adjust GATEWAY_IP to your needs
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x backup_mtd_via_ssh.sh
#   ./backup_mtd_via_ssh.sh
#
