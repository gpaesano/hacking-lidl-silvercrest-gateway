# restore_mtd_via_ssh.sh
#
# Description:
#   This script restores MTD partitions (mtd0 to mtd4) on the Lidl Silvercrest gateway via SSH.
#   It scans for matching .bin files (e.g., mtd2.bin) in the current directory.
#   For each match, it streams the binary to the gateway and flashes it using `dd`.
#
#   The script automatically handles mtd4 by checking if it's mounted, unmounting it before
#   flashing, and remounting it afterward to ensure filesystem integrity.
#
# Requirements:
#   - SSH access enabled on the gateway
#   - Corresponding mtdX.bin files must be present locally
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x restore_mtd_via_ssh.sh
#   ./restore_mtd_via_ssh.sh
#
